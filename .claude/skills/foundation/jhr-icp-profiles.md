# JHR ICP Profiles & Lead Scoring
## Foundation Skill — Scout, Closer, Concierge Reference This

**Purpose:** This skill defines JHR Photography's four Ideal Client Profiles with scoring criteria, buying signals, service alignment, and qualification protocols. Scout uses this to identify and score prospects. Closer uses it to tailor proposals. Concierge uses it to route inbound inquiries.

**Grounded In:** JHR ICPs 2026, JHR Sales Brain Framework (StoryBrand + Hormozi + Cardone), and JHR's real-world client base in Nashville.

## ICP #1: THE EXTERNAL OPERATOR
### National Event Production & DMC Decision-Maker

**Who They Are:**
A senior producer or operations leader at a national agency or DMC executing events in Nashville for demanding corporate clients. Measured internally on execution quality, partner performance, and how smoothly the event comes together — especially when they are not physically local.

**What They Want:**
Their Nashville event to feel controlled, polished, and professionally executed without needing to micromanage local vendors. Media is proof the event delivered value and reflected well on their agency.

**Their Core Problem:**
Local vendors often require too much oversight, create ambiguity around deliverables, or feel disconnected from how national agencies actually operate. Every extra question, delay, or correction reflects back on them.

**What Success Looks Like:**
A local media partner who operates as an extension of their team — already aligned to expectations, timelines, and standards — while delivering clean, usable assets their client immediately recognizes as professional.

**How JHR Guides Them:**
JHR integrates into their production model and delivers Corporate Event Coverage, Trade-Show Media Services, and Event Video Systems that feel predictable, polished, and agency-ready. We remove friction, protect their reputation, and make them look good to their client.

**StoryBrand Message:**
"You don't need another vendor — you need a local extension of your team who already understands how this work is supposed to run."

## ICP #2: THE INTERNAL OWNER
### Enterprise Marketing, Training, or Operations Leader

**Who They Are:**
A marketing director, training leader, or operations executive responsible for company-owned events such as annual conferences, leadership off-sites, training summits, or stakeholder meetings. These events are part of an ongoing business rhythm — not one-off productions.

**What They Want:**
Events that feel professional, cohesive, and worth the time and budget invested. Media should support internal alignment, external credibility, and long-term use — not just document what happened.

**Their Core Problem:**
Event media is often inconsistent, slow to deliver, or not aligned to how the organization actually communicates. They end up with assets that don't get used or don't reflect the quality of the organization.

**What Success Looks Like:**
A reliable partner who understands executive audiences, internal stakeholders, and brand standards — and delivers media that can be reused across communications, recruiting, training, and marketing.

**How JHR Guides Them:**
JHR provides Corporate Event Coverage, Executive Imaging, Executive Group Imaging Experience, and Executive Story System that create continuity year over year. We help them elevate the experience while giving them assets that continue working long after the event ends.

**StoryBrand Message:**
"We help you turn your events into professional assets your organization can use all year — not just memories."

### Internal Owner — Identification Criteria

**Job Titles to Look For:**
- VP/Director of Marketing, Brand Director
- VP/Director of Training & Development

- HR Director (for company events, headshots)
- Internal Communications Director

- Enterprise companies (500+ employees)
- Associations and membership organizations
- Healthcare systems
- Financial services firms
- Technology companies
- Professional services firms (law, consulting, accounting)

**Where to Find Them:**
- Nashville Business Journal "Book of Lists" (largest employers)
- Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce member directory
- Tennessee Society of Association Executives
- LinkedIn (search by company size + Nashville + relevant titles)
- Eventbrite/corporate event listings
- Company websites (events page, career page for culture events)

**Buying Signals:**
- Company has annual conference or leadership summit
- Job posting for "event coordinator" (signals event investment)
- New executive hire announced (headshot opportunity)
- Company expansion/new Nashville office
- Recent funding round or IPO (brand refresh, media investment)
- Posting about past event on LinkedIn without professional photos
- Anniversary, milestone, or rebrand event announced

**Qualifying Questions (Discovery):**
- "How does your organization currently handle event media?"
- "What do you do with the photos and video after the event?"
- "Is this a recurring event, or a one-time program?"
- "Who are the key stakeholders who need to be represented well?"
- "What's your internal timeline for using these assets?"

### Internal Owner — Scoring Rubric

| Factor | Weight | 5 Points | 3 Points | 1 Point |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Company Size** | 20% | 1,000+ employees | 200-999 | Under 200 |
| **Event Frequency** | 25% | Annual/quarterly recurring | 2+ events/year planned | One-time event |

## ICP #3: THE ROI OPERATOR
### Enterprise Exhibitor or Field Marketing Leader

**Who They Are:**
A field marketing or experiential leader responsible for booth performance at large conventions and trade shows. Judged on lead quality, engagement, and post-event sales impact — not aesthetics.

**What They Want:**
Their booth to stand out in a crowded show floor, drive meaningful conversations, and generate assets sales teams can actually follow up with.

**Their Core Problem:**
Swag gets ignored. Raffles attract the wrong people. Traditional photography doesn't move the needle. They need something that creates real engagement without slowing lead flow.

**What Success Looks Like:**
An activation that increases dwell time, captures qualified contact data, and gives attendees something genuinely valuable — while also producing usable content for sales and marketing.

**How JHR Guides Them:**
JHR delivers Headshot Activation as a proven engagement system, often paired with Social Recap System or Event Highlight Systems to extend value beyond the booth. We position the activation as a performance driver, not a creative expense.

**StoryBrand Message:**
"This isn't photography — it's a booth engagement system that produces leads and assets your sales team actually uses."

- Job posting for trade show or field marketing role

- "How do you currently drive engagement at your booth?"
- "What does your sales team need from the event to follow up effectively?"
- "How many shows do you attend per year?"

## ICP #4: THE MARKET GATEKEEPER
### Venue, Hotel, & Convention Event Leadership

**Who They Are:**
Sales, events, or marketing leaders at hotels and venues who support planners daily and influence which vendors get mentioned, trusted, or quietly recommended.

**What They Want:**
Planners to have smooth, successful events that reflect well on the venue. When vendors perform well, the venue looks better. When vendors struggle, the venue absorbs the friction.

**Their Core Problem:**
They are often asked for recommendations but hesitate to suggest vendors who might create issues, confusion, or extra work for their team.

**What Success Looks Like:**
Partners they can reference confidently — who are professional, prepared, respectful of venue staff, and capable of operating without exceptions or special handling.

**How JHR Guides Them:**
JHR shows up as a disciplined, professional media partner delivering Corporate Event Coverage, Trade-Show Media Services, and Executive Imaging with consistency and respect for the venue environment. We make their planners happier — and their jobs easier.

**StoryBrand Message:**
"We're the kind of partner you can mention without worrying how it will reflect back on you."

---

## DISQUALIFICATION CRITERIA

Immediately disqualify (score = 0) if ANY of these apply:

1. **Demands hourly pricing** after value explanation — fundamentally misaligned
2. **Budget ceiling below $499** — can't deliver JHR quality at this level
3. **Social/personal events** (weddings, birthday parties) — not JHR's market
4. **Wants to "try before they buy"** with free work — disrespects expertise
5. **Timeline under 48 hours** without premium urgency pricing agreement
6. **Located outside JHR service area** with no operator coverage (unless expansion target)

---

## THE STRATEGIC THROUGH-LINE

Across all four ICPs, JHR plays the same StoryBrand role:

- **The Client is the Hero** trying to deliver a successful event
- **JHR is the Guide** with a proven system and calm authority
- **The Plan** is clear service alignment (not custom chaos)
- **Success** is engagement, usable assets, and professional outcomes
- **Failure** is friction, underperformance, or wasted investment

Every Scout brief, every Closer proposal, every Concierge response should reinforce this positioning. We don't compete on price. We compete on Execution Confidence.
