# Ralph Progress Log - JHR Website

## Codebase Patterns
- Next.js 14 App Router structure: pages in /app/[route]/page.tsx
- Components organized by category: /components/ui/, /components/layout/, /components/admin/
- Tailwind CSS with custom brand colors: jhr-black, jhr-white, jhr-gold
- Use Lucide React for icons (already installed)
- Use Framer Motion for animations (already installed)
- Dark theme by default, gold (#C9A227) for accents and CTAs
