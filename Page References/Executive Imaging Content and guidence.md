# **JHR Photography — Executive Imaging™ Service Page Copy & Implementation Guide**

**Document Purpose:** Provide finalized copy for the Executive Imaging™ service detail page at /services/executive-imaging (replacing the current /services/corporate-headshot-program route). This page serves one broad audience across multiple buyer roles, with two service tiers presented on a single page. Copy, FAQs, and structure are designed accordingly.

**Important for Agent:** This document contains COPY ONLY. Do not rewrite or restructure existing page layout, component architecture, or routing. Apply copy to existing elements. The current route /services/corporate-headshot-program should be redirected to /services/executive-imaging. Where new structural elements are suggested, add them within the current component framework.

## **Page Strategy: One Service, Two Tiers, Multiple Buyers**

Executive Imaging™ is NOT a headshot session you book at a studio. It is an on-site professional imaging service designed for the reality that getting busy executives and team members into the same room at the same time is one of the hardest things a company can coordinate. When you finally have them together — at a conference, a leadership meeting, an annual event — that's the moment to capture everyone on-brand, on-background, and looking their best.

This page must communicate that core insight clearly while serving multiple buyer types who all arrive with the same underlying need.

**The Buyers (Equal Priority — All Three):**

**Buyer 1: HR / People Ops Leader** They're responsible for employer brand, recruiting assets, and company-wide consistency. They know the current headshots on the website are a mess — different backgrounds, different quality, some from five years ago. They want everyone aligned. This maps to ICP \#2: The Internal Owner.

**Buyer 2: Marketing Director** They're responsible for brand consistency across the website, annual reports, press materials, and executive communications. They need leadership photos that match the organization's standards — not whatever each exec grabbed from their phone. This maps to ICP \#2: The Internal Owner.

**Buyer 3: Executive Assistant / Office Manager** They've been tasked with "getting headshots done" and need to find someone who can handle the logistics, work around executive schedules, and make it painless. They're looking for a partner who makes them look competent for coordinating it well. This maps to ICP \#1: The External Operator (in a coordination role).

**What All Three Buyers Share:** They need a partner who can show up, set up, and move through a group of busy professionals efficiently — with consistent backgrounds, professional direction, and on-site image selection — so nobody has to come back for a second session.

**Two Service Tiers (Same Page):**

**Executive Imaging™ (1–15 People)** — The premium tier for leadership teams, board members, and small executive groups. More time per person, elevated attention, and a high-touch experience designed for C-suite and senior leadership.

**Executive Group Imaging Experience™ (16–50+ People)** — The streamlined tier for departments, full teams, and company-wide programs. Station-based setup for consistent results at scale. Everyone gets the same background, the same professional treatment, and the same quality — with efficient throughput that respects everyone's time.

**Camera Ready Touchup Service™ Positioning:**

* **Included** in Executive Group Imaging Experience (16–50+) engagements.  
* **Highly recommended add-on** for Executive Imaging (1–15). Satisfaction is significantly higher when it's included. The page should position it as the recommended experience, not an afterthought.

**Strategic Pairing: Corporate Event Coverage™** Executive Imaging pairs naturally with Corporate Event Coverage — not trade shows. The positioning is: "We were already on-site documenting the event, so we set up a professional imaging station and captured the entire leadership team while they were all in one place." This saved time, saved budget, and turned a logistical challenge into a seamless add-on to an event they were already producing.

**Programmatic SEO / GEO Strategy:** This page links out to specialty headshot landing pages (Corporate Headshots, Lawyer Headshots, Banker Headshots, Educator Headshots, Actor Headshots, LinkedIn Headshots, etc.). These links appear naturally in the content and FAQ section, establishing the hub-and-spoke architecture. This page becomes a second hub pointing to the same spoke pages as the Headshot Activation page — which strengthens the internal link structure for SEO. Those spoke pages don't need to exist yet — the link structure is planted now for when they're built.

## **SECTION 1: Page Hero**

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** Executive Imaging™

**\[H1 Headline\]** Everyone on Brand. Everyone in One Session. Everyone Looks Great.

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** Getting your leadership team or entire department into the same room is hard enough. Getting them all professionally photographed — with consistent backgrounds, professional direction, and images they're actually proud of — shouldn't add to the challenge. Executive Imaging brings the full studio experience to your event or location, so every person walks away with a polished, on-brand headshot without anyone having to schedule a separate session.

**\[Secondary Context Line\]** Available for leadership teams of 1–15 or full departments and company-wide programs of 16–50+.

**\[Primary CTA Button\]** Talk With Our Team

**\[Secondary CTA Button\]** Check Availability

### **Image Direction**

**\[IMAGE — Hero\]** The hero image should show the experience in action — not just a finished headshot. Show a professional setup on-site at a corporate event or office environment: a JHR operator directing an executive, professional lighting and backdrop visible, someone waiting comfortably nearby. The image should communicate EASE, PROFESSIONALISM, and EFFICIENCY — this is something that happens smoothly within a busy day, not a production that takes over the room.

If a secondary image strip is used: show 2–3 finished headshot results — different people, different styles (corporate, casual professional, executive portrait) — all with a consistent, polished look. This demonstrates that every person gets the same quality and treatment.

### **Implementation Notes**

* The headline addresses the core pain point immediately: consistency, convenience, and quality in one session.  
* The secondary context line introduces the two tiers without forcing a choice — the conversation with the team is where the right tier is determined.  
* Hero should feel calm, professional, and efficient. This is ICP \#2 territory — internal owners who want things to look polished and feel easy.  
* Do NOT show studio environments. The entire point is that this comes to you.

## **SECTION 2: The Problem (Empathy \+ Villain)**

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** The Headshot Problem

**\[H2 Heading\]** Mismatched Photos. Outdated Images. And Executives Who Never Have Time.

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** Your website has headshots from three different years, two different photographers, and at least one person who's no longer with the company. Half your leadership team hasn't updated their photo since the last administration. And every time someone suggests "let's just get new headshots," the calendar conversation alone takes a month.

**\[Supporting Line\]** The problem isn't that people don't want updated headshots. It's that coordinating them feels like a project nobody has time to manage.

### **Image Direction**

**\[IMAGE — Optional\]** If using an image, a subtle visual showing a corporate website "About" or "Leadership" page with obviously inconsistent headshot styles — different backgrounds, different quality, different eras — would powerfully illustrate the problem without needing to explain it. If that's too complex or specific, skip the image — the copy carries this section effectively.

### **Implementation Notes**

* This section names the villain (coordination burden, inconsistency, the mental load of getting busy people to sit for a photo) without using fear or failure language. The tone is knowing and empathetic — "we've seen this a hundred times."  
* The supporting line reframes the problem: it's not about willingness, it's about logistics. This is important because it positions JHR as the logistics solution, not the creative solution.  
* Keep this section tight. It sets up the solution.

---

## **SECTION 3: The Solution — What Executive Imaging Actually Delivers**

This is the education section. Most visitors are searching for "corporate headshots" and expecting a studio. This section reframes the service as an on-site, event-integrated experience designed around the reality that executives are busy and rarely available.

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** How It Works

**\[H2 Heading\]** A Professional Imaging Experience That Comes to You

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** Executive Imaging sets up a complete professional headshot station at your event, office, or meeting location. We bring the lighting, the backgrounds, and the professional direction. Your team shows up, gets guided through the process, and walks away with a finished image they selected on-site. No follow-up sessions. No waiting weeks for proofs. No herding anyone back for a reshoot.

**\[The Experience — 4 Key Moments\]**

**The Setup** We arrive early and build a complete professional imaging environment — consistent backgrounds, controlled lighting, and a comfortable space that doesn't disrupt your event or workday. Whether it's a conference breakout room or a corner of your office, we make it work.

**The Direction** Every person gets professional posing and expression coaching from a certified operator. This isn't "stand here and smile." We guide posture, expression, and confidence — so people who dread having their photo taken walk away saying it was actually enjoyable.

**The Selection** No waiting for proofs. Every person reviews their images on-site and selects their favorite immediately. They see exactly what they're getting before they leave the room. This eliminates the back-and-forth that slows down every other headshot process.

**The Delivery** Selected images are professionally retouched and digitally delivered — ready for your website, LinkedIn, company directory, and marketing materials. Fast turnaround, multiple format options, and quality that matches your organization's standards.

### **Image Direction**

**\[IMAGE — Per Key Moment (Recommended)\]** This section benefits from visual storytelling:

* The Setup: A professional imaging station set up in a corporate environment — lighting, backdrop, equipment visible but not overwhelming. Should feel clean and organized.  
* The Direction: An operator coaching an executive — showing the human interaction, not just the technical setup. Confidence and ease visible on the subject's face.  
* The Selection: A person reviewing their images on a tethered display — the "pick your favorite" moment. This image proves the on-site selection promise.  
* The Delivery: A finished headshot displayed on a screen, LinkedIn profile, or company website. Show the polished result in context.

### **Interaction Recommendations**

**\[INTERACTION — Step Reveal\]** Each key moment reveals on scroll — staggered, with image and copy appearing together. Similar to the homepage Journey section. If using an alternating image/copy layout (image left, copy right, then swap), the scroll reveal should follow the visual reading path.

---

## **SECTION 4: Two Tiers — Right-Sized for Your Team**

This section presents both service tiers clearly, helping the visitor self-select based on their group size and needs. Tabs, toggle, or stacked blocks all work.

### **Copy**

**\[H2 Heading\]** Two Formats. Same Professional Standard.

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** Whether you're imaging your C-suite or your entire company, Executive Imaging is designed to deliver consistent, professional results at the right scale.

---

**\[Tier Block 1: Executive Imaging™ (1–15 People)\]**

**\[Block Label\]** For Leadership Teams & Small Groups

**\[Block Heading\]** Elevated Attention for the People Who Represent Your Brand

**\[Block Body\]** Executive Imaging™ is our premium, high-touch format designed for leadership teams, board members, and senior executives — the people whose images carry the most weight. Each person gets dedicated time with a certified operator, professional posing and expression coaching, on-site image selection, and full retouching. The experience is unhurried, personalized, and designed to produce images that match the seniority and visibility of the people in front of the camera.

For the best results, we highly recommend adding our Camera Ready Touchup Service™. Having a professional hair and makeup touchup artist on-site before each session dramatically increases comfort and confidence — and we consistently see significantly higher satisfaction when it's part of the experience.

**\[What You Get — Short List\]**

* 5–10 minutes of dedicated time per person  
* Professional posing and expression coaching  
* Studio-quality lighting with consistent backgrounds  
* On-site image selection — each person picks their favorite before leaving  
* 1–2 fully retouched images per person  
* Digital delivery in multiple formats  
* Final Frame Guarantee™

**\[Recommended Add-On\]** Camera Ready Touchup Service™ — Professional hair and makeup touchup on-site. We highly recommend this for every Executive Imaging session. \[LINK → see Section on Camera Ready Touchup\]

**\[Best For\]** C-suite teams · Board of Directors · Senior leadership · Department heads · Executive committee members · Small professional groups

**\[Value Callout\]** For groups under 15, Executive Imaging delivers a better result at a better value than scheduling individual headshot sessions — with consistent backgrounds, professional direction, and the convenience of getting everyone done at once.

---

**\[Tier Block 2: Executive Group Imaging Experience™ (16–50+ People)\]**

**\[Block Label\]** For Departments & Company-Wide Programs

**\[Block Heading\]** Consistent, Professional Results for Your Entire Team

**\[Block Body\]** Executive Group Imaging Experience™ is our streamlined format for larger teams, full departments, and company-wide headshot programs. We set up professional imaging stations designed for efficient throughput — so every person gets the same background, the same lighting, the same professional treatment, and the same quality of result. No one gets the "rushed" version. No one gets a different look.

Camera Ready Touchup Service™ is included with every Executive Group Imaging Experience. Every person gets a professional touchup before stepping in front of the camera — which keeps the energy positive, the confidence high, and the results consistent across your entire group.

For groups of 30+ with limited time, we deploy multiple operators to keep the experience smooth and on schedule without sacrificing quality.

**\[What You Get — Short List\]**

* Professional imaging stations with consistent backgrounds and lighting  
* Camera Ready Touchup Service™ (included)  
* Professional posing and expression coaching for every person  
* On-site image selection  
* Standard retouching on all selected images  
* Bulk gallery delivery within 48 hours  
* White-label branding available  
* Final Frame Guarantee™

**\[Best For\]** Department-wide headshot updates · Annual company photo programs · New hire onboarding sessions · Company rebrand rollouts · Large team alignment · Full-staff imaging days

---

### **Implementation Notes**

* These two tiers can be presented as tabs (Leadership Teams | Full Teams), as stacked full-width sections, or as two columns side by side. Stacked blocks with clear visual separation are recommended — the content length justifies vertical space.  
* Both tiers link to the same CTA ("Talk With Our Team") — the conversation is where JHR customizes the approach based on headcount, timeline, and venue.  
* The Camera Ready Touchup positioning is intentionally different between tiers: "highly recommended" for small groups, "included" for large groups. This reflects the pricing structure without discussing price.  
* The value callout in Tier 1 addresses the comparison objection directly: "Why not just send everyone to get their own headshots?" Answer: consistency, convenience, and better value.  
* Do NOT include pricing on this page. Investment discussions happen in the strategy call.

## **SECTION 5: The Event Pairing — Corporate Event Coverage \+ Executive Imaging**

This section is a strategic cross-sell that positions Executive Imaging as the natural complement to an event JHR is already documenting. The framing is practical, not promotional: you have your people together, take advantage of it.

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** The Smart Pairing

**\[H2 Heading\]** Already Hosting an Event? That's the Perfect Time for Headshots.

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** The hardest part of updating your team's headshots is getting everyone in one place at the same time. If you're already producing a conference, leadership meeting, or annual event with [Corporate Event Coverage™](https://claude.ai/services/corporate-event-coverage), you've already solved that problem.

**\[Supporting Detail\]** When you pair Executive Imaging with Corporate Event Coverage, we set up a professional imaging station alongside your event documentation — so your team can rotate through for headshots between sessions without missing a beat. Your event gets documented. Your leadership team gets updated. And your organization walks away with a complete set of professional assets from a single engagement.

It saves time. It saves budget. And it turns a logistical headache into something people actually enjoy.

**\[CTA Button\]** Learn About Corporate Event Coverage™ → \[LINK → /services/corporate-event-coverage\]

### **Image Direction**

**\[IMAGE\]** Show a professional imaging station set up adjacent to a conference or corporate event environment — the event happening in the background or nearby, the headshot station operating smoothly in its own space. This should communicate that both services run in parallel without competing for attention.

### **Implementation Notes**

* This section is NOT a full pitch for Corporate Event Coverage — that's what the dedicated service page does. This is a contextual introduction that helps the visitor see the efficiency of pairing.  
* The framing is deliberately practical: "You already have everyone together. Take advantage of it." This resonates with all three buyer types (HR, Marketing, EA) because it solves their coordination problem.  
* This pairing does NOT extend to trade shows. Only Headshot Activation pairs with trade show environments. Executive Imaging pairs with conferences, corporate events, and scheduled on-site sessions.  
* The link to the Corporate Event Coverage page should be clear and prominent.

## **SECTION 6: What's Included — Package Clarity**

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** What's Included

**\[H2 Heading\]** Professional Results. Zero Logistics on Your End.

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** Executive Imaging is fully managed. We bring the equipment, the expertise, and the professional direction. You provide the space and the people. Here's what's included in every engagement.

**\[Included Items — Clean List or Grid\]**

* **Certified Operators with Professional Direction** — Our operators don't point and shoot. They coach posture, guide expressions, and make even camera-shy executives feel comfortable and confident in under a minute.  
* **Consistent Backgrounds & Studio-Quality Lighting** — Every person is photographed with the same professional setup. Your team page will finally look like it belongs to one organization.  
* **On-Site Image Selection** — No waiting for proofs. Every person sees their images and selects their favorite before they leave the room. This eliminates weeks of back-and-forth.  
* **Professional Retouching & Digital Delivery** — Selected images are fully retouched and delivered digitally in multiple formats — ready for your website, LinkedIn, company directory, press materials, and internal communications.  
* **White-Label Branding** — Your organization's identity on the delivery gallery and communications. The experience feels like yours, not ours.  
* **Final Frame Guarantee™** — Every delivered image meets JHR's professional quality standard. If it doesn't represent your people well, it doesn't leave our system.

**\[Conditional Item — Camera Ready Touchup Service™\]**

* **Camera Ready Touchup Service™** — A professional hair and makeup touchup artist on-site. Included with Executive Group Imaging Experience (16–50+). Highly recommended add-on for Executive Imaging (1–15). This is the single biggest driver of satisfaction we see — people feel more confident, more relaxed, and the results show it.

### **Implementation Notes**

* Present as a clean grid (2 columns on desktop) or a visually structured list. Each item: bold heading \+ one-line description.  
* The Camera Ready Touchup item should be visually distinct — perhaps a highlighted card or a "Recommended" badge — to draw attention without being pushy.  
* No pricing on this page. Investment discussions happen in the strategy call.  
* This section answers: "What do I actually get?" and "How much do I have to manage?" — the two questions every buyer is asking.

---

## **SECTION 7: Headshot Styles — Link-Out to Programmatic Pages**

This section introduces the variety of headshot styles available within an Executive Imaging session, naturally creating the hub-and-spoke link structure for programmatic SEO/GEO pages. This mirrors the same spoke architecture planted on the Headshot Activation page — giving these programmatic pages two inbound hubs.

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** Headshot Styles

**\[H2 Heading\]** Professional Headshots Tailored to Your Industry

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** Every organization has its own visual standard — and every person in front of the camera has their own professional context. Our operators tailor the approach to match, whether your team needs polished corporate portraits or something more modern and approachable. Here are some of the most common styles we deliver.

**\[Style Cards — Compact Grid\]**

**Corporate Headshot** The standard for enterprise professionals — clean background, controlled lighting, and a confident, approachable expression. Used across company websites, internal directories, annual reports, and investor communications. \[LINK-FUTURE → /headshots/corporate-headshots\]

**Legal & Finance Headshot** Authority and trust. Tailored for attorneys, bankers, financial advisors, and consultants who need an image that communicates credibility and professionalism. \[LINK-FUTURE → /headshots/lawyer-headshots\] \[LINK-FUTURE → /headshots/banker-headshots\]

**Executive Portrait** Elevated and intentional. For C-suite, board members, and senior leadership who need an image that matches their role. More refined lighting, controlled environment, and premium finishing. \[LINK-FUTURE → /headshots/executive-headshots\]

**Casual Professional Headshot** Modern and approachable. Ideal for tech, creative, and startup professionals who want to look polished without looking stiff. Slightly relaxed posing, natural expressions, contemporary feel. \[LINK-FUTURE → /headshots/casual-professional-headshots\]

**Educator & Academic Headshot** Approachable and professional. For faculty, administrators, and academic leaders who need imagery for university websites, program directories, and research profiles. \[LINK-FUTURE → /headshots/educator-headshots\]

**Actor & Talent Headshot** Expressive and versatile. Designed for performers and talent who need images that communicate range, personality, and castability. Multiple looks and expressions captured in a single session. \[LINK-FUTURE → /headshots/actor-headshots\]

**LinkedIn & Professional Profile Headshot** Optimized for digital presence. Clean, well-lit, and formatted specifically for LinkedIn and professional networking platforms. The headshot most professionals need but never get around to updating. \[LINK-FUTURE → /headshots/linkedin-headshots\]

**Real Estate & Sales Headshot** Warm, confident, and client-facing. Designed for professionals whose headshot IS their first impression — real estate agents, sales leaders, and client-facing consultants. \[LINK-FUTURE → /headshots/real-estate-headshots\]

**Healthcare Professional Headshot** Clean, trustworthy, and approachable. For physicians, practitioners, and healthcare administrators who need imagery for hospital websites, practice directories, and credentialing. \[LINK-FUTURE → /headshots/healthcare-headshots\]

### **Implementation Notes**

* Each style card: small sample image (if available) \+ heading \+ short description \+ link.  
* Links go to programmatic landing pages when built. For now, use placeholder routes or link to \# with a defined route structure the agent can build against.  
* **Route structure for future pages:** /headshots/\[style\]-headshots (e.g., /headshots/corporate-headshots, /headshots/educator-headshots). This keeps them outside the /services/ path and creates a separate content hub. This matches the architecture already planted on the Headshot Activation page.  
* New spoke pages added in this document (not in Headshot Activation doc): Educator Headshots, Actor Headshots, LinkedIn Headshots. These should also be added to the Headshot Activation style section when those pages are updated.  
* This section is compact — 3 across on desktop, 2 on tablet, stacked on mobile. It's a discovery moment, not deep content.  
* The section naturally answers: "Can you handle different styles within the same session?" — which is a real concern for mixed-role organizations.

## **SECTION 8: Social Proof — Executive Imaging-Specific Testimonials**

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** The Results

**\[H2 Heading\]** What Happens When Everyone's Finally on Brand

**\[PLACEHOLDER — Testimonial 1: HR / People Ops Leader\]** Quote should reference: consistency across team photos, how easy the process was for busy executives, how the results elevated the company's online presence, or how the imaging session was integrated with an existing event.

Attribution:

* Name, Title  
* Organization Type: HR / People Ops  
* Company or Industry Context

**\[PLACEHOLDER — Testimonial 2: Marketing Director\]** Quote should reference: brand consistency, quality of images for website or marketing materials, how the session solved a long-standing inconsistency problem, or how the pairing with event coverage saved time.

Attribution:

* Name, Title  
* Organization Type: Marketing / Brand  
* Company or Industry Context

**\[PLACEHOLDER — Testimonial 3: Executive or Participant (Optional)\]** Quote from someone who was photographed — referencing how the experience was easier than expected, how the coaching made them feel comfortable, or how they actually enjoyed it. This humanizes the experience from the subject's perspective.

Attribution:

* Name, Title  
* "Participant at \[Company/Event Name\]"

### **Implementation Notes**

* 2–3 testimonials. Same card format as homepage and other service pages.  
* If only 2 strong testimonials exist, use 2\. Don't fill with weak quotes.  
* A testimonial that references the event pairing (Corporate Event Coverage \+ Executive Imaging in one engagement) would be especially powerful and directly supports the Section 5 cross-sell.  
* A participant quote that says something like "I actually had fun" or "it was the best headshot I've ever gotten" is gold — it answers the objection every camera-shy executive has.

---

## **SECTION 9: FAQ — Executive Imaging**

These FAQs are specific to the Executive Imaging service page. They address real questions from all three buyer types, clarify the difference between tiers, and plant natural links to programmatic pages and complementary services.

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** Common Questions

**\[H2 Heading\]** Executive Imaging FAQs

---

**Q: What's the difference between Executive Imaging and Executive Group Imaging Experience?**

A: Executive Imaging™ is designed for leadership teams and small groups of 1–15 people. Each person gets more dedicated time, elevated attention, and 1–2 fully retouched images. Executive Group Imaging Experience™ is our streamlined format for larger groups of 16–50+ people — station-based, efficient, and designed for consistent results across your entire team. Both formats include professional posing, expression coaching, on-site image selection, and the same quality standard. The right format depends on group size and how much time your team has available — we'll recommend the best fit during our planning conversation.

---

**Q: What does the Camera Ready Touchup Service include?**

A: A professional hair and makeup touchup artist is on-site before each person steps in front of the camera. It's a quick, confidence-building touchup — not a full styling session — and it takes about two minutes per person. This service is included with Executive Group Imaging Experience (16–50+) and available as a recommended add-on for Executive Imaging (1–15). We consistently see higher satisfaction and better results when it's part of the experience.

---

**Q: How long does the session take per person?**

A: For Executive Imaging (1–15), each person typically spends 5–10 minutes in front of the camera — more time per person, more attention to detail. For Executive Group Imaging Experience (16–50+), we optimize for efficient throughput — each person gets professional direction, coaching, and on-site selection within a streamlined flow. For larger groups or tight timelines, we deploy multiple operators to keep the experience smooth without sacrificing quality.

---

**Q: Can we do headshots alongside our conference or corporate event?**

A: Absolutely — and this is one of the smartest ways to use Executive Imaging. If we're already on-site with [Corporate Event Coverage™](https://claude.ai/services/corporate-event-coverage), we set up a professional imaging station alongside your event documentation. Your team rotates through for headshots between sessions. No separate scheduling. No additional logistics. You get your event documented and your team's headshots updated in one engagement — it saves time and budget.

---

**Q: Do people select their photos on-site?**

A: Yes. Every person reviews their images immediately after their session and selects their favorite on the spot. This eliminates the most time-consuming part of any headshot process — the weeks of emailing proofs back and forth. They see what they're getting before they leave the room.

---

**Q: What headshot styles do you offer?**

A: Our operators tailor the approach to each person's professional context. Common styles include [corporate headshots](https://claude.ai/headshots/corporate-headshots), [executive portraits](https://claude.ai/headshots/executive-headshots), [casual professional headshots](https://claude.ai/headshots/casual-professional-headshots), [legal and finance headshots](https://claude.ai/headshots/lawyer-headshots), and [LinkedIn profile photos](https://claude.ai/headshots/linkedin-headshots). For organizations with mixed roles — executives, creatives, client-facing staff — we adjust the direction within the same session so every person gets a result that fits their role.

---

**Q: How much space do you need?**

A: A standard Executive Imaging setup requires approximately an 8x10 foot area — a conference room, office corner, or event breakout space works well. For Executive Group Imaging Experience with Camera Ready Touchup Service, we may need a slightly larger area to accommodate the touchup station alongside the imaging setup. We'll discuss layout during planning and work within your available space.

---

**Q: Can you match our existing brand guidelines for headshot style?**

A: Yes. If your organization has specific standards for headshot backgrounds, lighting style, cropping, or format, we'll match them. Many organizations use Executive Imaging to establish a new visual standard — and then we maintain that consistency across future sessions. Either way, we align to your brand, not the other way around.

---

**Q: How is this different from booking individual headshots at a studio?**

A: Three ways. First, consistency — when everyone is photographed by the same team, with the same lighting and backgrounds, in the same session, the results look like they belong together. Studio sessions booked individually over weeks or months rarely match. Second, convenience — no one has to leave the office or the event to go to a studio. We come to you. Third, value — for groups, Executive Imaging delivers a better result at a lower per-person cost than scheduling individual studio sessions. Your team gets a higher-quality product with less coordination on your end.

---

**Q: How far in advance should we book?**

A: We recommend booking at least 4–6 weeks before your session to ensure operator availability and allow time for planning. If you're pairing Executive Imaging with Corporate Event Coverage at a conference or corporate event, 8–12 weeks is ideal so we can coordinate both services together. If your date is sooner, reach out anyway — we'll do our best to accommodate.

---

### **Implementation Notes**

* FAQs should be collapsible/accordion style — heading visible, body expands on click.  
* Place after testimonials and before the final CTA. This is the "last objection" layer — answer it, then invite them to act.  
* The FAQ about "how is this different from booking individual headshots" is critical for conversion — it directly addresses the comparison most buyers are making in their head.  
* The FAQ about pairing with Corporate Event Coverage reinforces the Section 5 cross-sell naturally.  
* Links within FAQ answers to programmatic pages use the \[LINK-FUTURE\] route structure. Links to existing service pages use current routes.  
* FAQ schema markup (JSON-LD) should be added for SEO. This helps FAQs appear in Google's featured snippets and AI search results.

## **SECTION 10: Final CTA**

### **Copy**

**\[Micro-Tagline\]** Executive Imaging™ — Nashville's on-site professional headshot experience

**\[H2 Heading\]** Your Team Deserves Headshots That Look Like They Belong Together.

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** Tell us about your team — the headcount, the timeline, and whether you're pairing this with an event we're already covering. We'll recommend the right format and give you a clear picture of what to expect.

**\[Primary CTA Button\]** Talk With Our Team

**\[Secondary CTA Button\]** Check Availability

### **Implementation Notes**

* Dark gradient background. Same treatment as homepage and services hub final CTAs.  
* Micro-tagline positions the service name one more time for SEO reinforcement.  
* The lead paragraph invites the visitor to share context — headcount, timeline, event pairing — signaling that JHR customizes the approach rather than selling a one-size-fits-all package.

## **Route Change & Redirect**

**Current route:** /services/corporate-headshot-program **New route:** /services/executive-imaging

**Required:** 301 redirect from /services/corporate-headshot-program → /services/executive-imaging. Update all internal links site-wide (navigation, footer, service hub page, any cross-links from other service pages).

**Navigation update:** The services menu item should change from "Corporate Headshot Program" to "Executive Imaging" to match the new service name and route.

## **Programmatic SEO Link Architecture**

This page becomes a second hub (alongside Headshot Activation) for headshot-style spoke pages. Recommended route structure:

| Future Page | Route | Link Appears In |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Corporate Headshots | /headshots/corporate-headshots | Styles section, FAQ |
| Lawyer Headshots | /headshots/lawyer-headshots | Styles section, FAQ |
| Banker / Finance Headshots | /headshots/banker-headshots | Styles section |
| Casual Professional Headshots | /headshots/casual-professional-headshots | Styles section, FAQ |
| Executive Headshots | /headshots/executive-headshots | Styles section, FAQ |
| Real Estate Headshots | /headshots/real-estate-headshots | Styles section |
| Healthcare Professional Headshots | /headshots/healthcare-headshots | Styles section |
| Educator Headshots | /headshots/educator-headshots | Styles section |
| Actor / Talent Headshots | /headshots/actor-headshots | Styles section |
| LinkedIn / Professional Profile Headshots | /headshots/linkedin-headshots | Styles section, FAQ |

**New spoke pages not in Headshot Activation doc:** Educator Headshots, Actor/Talent Headshots, LinkedIn Headshots. These three should also be added to the Headshot Activation page (Section 7\) when that page is next updated.

As these pages are built, internal links on this page activate automatically if routes are defined now with placeholder targets.

**Important:** These spoke pages live under /headshots/, NOT /services/. This keeps the service architecture clean and creates a separate content hub that can rank independently for "\[industry\] headshots Nashville" queries.

## **Internal Service Cross-Link Architecture**

| Linked Service | Route | Link Appears In |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Corporate Event Coverage™ | /services/corporate-event-coverage | Section 5, FAQ |
| Headshot Activation™ | /services/headshot-activation | FAQ (if relevant context) |

**Important:** Executive Imaging does NOT pair with Trade-Show Media Services. Only Headshot Activation pairs with trade show environments. Do not create cross-links between Executive Imaging and trade show services.

## **SEO / GEO Strategy Notes**

**Primary Keywords (Natural Integration):**

* Corporate headshots Nashville  
* Executive headshots Nashville  
* Team headshots Nashville  
* Professional headshot photographer Nashville  
* On-site corporate headshots  
* Company headshot program  
* Executive imaging Nashville

**Entity Nesting (For AI Search):** Naturally group: "Executive Imaging™," "Executive Group Imaging Experience™," "Camera Ready Touchup Service™," "Nashville Corporate Headshots," "On-Site Professional Imaging," "Corporate Event Coverage™"

**Snippet Bait:** The tier comparison (Section 4\) and the FAQ about "how is this different from individual studio headshots" are the highest-value extraction targets for AI search. Structure them cleanly.

**Citation Bait:** The "everyone together at the same time" insight — that the hardest part of updating team headshots is logistics, not photography — is a specific, practical framing AI models will favor over generic "professional headshot services" content.

## **Copy Quality Checklist**

1. ✅ Executive Imaging is framed as an **on-site professional experience**, not a studio headshot session  
2. ✅ Both tiers (1–15 and 16–50+) are presented clearly on one page  
3. ✅ All three buyer types (HR, Marketing, EA) are served by the copy  
4. ✅ JHR is the Guide — the planner/coordinator is the Hero  
5. ✅ The villain is **coordination burden and inconsistency**, not failure or risk  
6. ✅ No photography jargon, hourly rates, or equipment specs  
7. ✅ Camera Ready Touchup is positioned as **included** (large groups) and **highly recommended** (small groups)  
8. ✅ Corporate Event Coverage pairing is framed as **practical efficiency**, not upsell  
9. ✅ Headshot style spoke pages are linked naturally with future-proof routes  
10. ✅ FAQs address real buying objections and tier confusion  
11. ✅ CTAs are "Talk With Our Team" or "Check Availability"  
12. ✅ The page answers: "Can you get everyone done at once, on-brand, without it being a headache?" — YES  
13. ✅ No pairing with trade show services (only Headshot Activation pairs with trade shows)
