# **JHR Photography — Event Video Systems™ Service Page Copy & Implementation Guide**

**Document Purpose:** Provide finalized copy for the Event Video Systems™ service page at /services/event-video-systems. This page serves a unique function within the JHR site: it is both a service destination page AND a video selection guide. Most visitors arriving here know they need video but don't know which kind. The page must educate them, help them self-select, and give them confidence that the right system exists for their event — without requiring them to understand production terminology.

**Important for Agent:** This document contains COPY ONLY. Do not rewrite or restructure existing page layout, component architecture, or routing. Apply copy to existing elements. Where new structural elements are suggested, add them within the current component framework.

## **Page Strategy: A Selection Guide That Sells by Educating**

This page is different from every other JHR service page. The other pages are destination pages — a planner knows they need trade show media or executive imaging and lands on the right page. This page is a navigation page — a planner knows they need video but doesn't know the difference between a highlight reel, a testimonial package, a leadership interview production, or social-first content.

The page must do three things:

1. **Educate** — Explain what each video system does, in planner language, without production jargon  
2. **Guide selection** — Help the visitor identify which system fits their event based on what they're trying to accomplish  
3. **Position video as essential** — Reinforce that video is the completion of the media system, not an add-on to photography

**Service Architecture on This Page:**

**Three Core Video Systems (Equal Tiers):**

* **Event Highlight System™** — Post-event recap / sizzle reel  
* **Event Highlight \+ Vox System™** — Recap \+ on-site interviews and testimonials  
* **Executive Story System™** — Dedicated leadership messaging production (flagged for future dedicated page)

**One Enhancement Layer (Not a Peer Tier):**

* **Social Recap System™** — Rapid-turn social video that layers onto any video or photography engagement

Social Recap is NOT presented as a fourth equal option. It's positioned as an enhancement — the real-time social layer you add to any engagement to extend content into the feed while the event is still happening.

**Primary Buyers:**

**Buyer 1: Convention / Conference Organizer (ICP \#1 and \#2)** They're producing a multi-day event and want video that captures the energy, the voices, and the story — content they'll use for marketing, membership, and sponsor deliverables for the next twelve months.

**Buyer 2: Trade Show / Expo Organizer (ICP \#1 and \#3)** They want floor energy captured on video — highlight reels, exhibitor testimonials, social clips. Video proves the show's value and fuels post-event marketing.

**Buyer 3: Corporate Leader / Internal Owner (ICP \#2)** They want leadership messaging, executive interviews, or a company story video. This buyer is often triggered by having leadership already on-site for an event.

**Buyer 4: Event Planner Adding Video to Photography (All ICPs)** They've already booked or are considering a photography service (Convention Media, Trade-Show Media, Corporate Event Coverage) and want to understand how video completes the engagement.

**Key Positioning (Internal — Do Not Display):** Video is never an add-on. It is the completion of the media system. Per the Sales Brain framework: "Never sell video as an add-on. Always frame it as completion of the media system." Every section on this page should reinforce that video and photography work together as an integrated system — not as a base service plus an upsell.

## **SECTION 1: Page Hero**

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** Event Video Systems™

**\[H1 Headline\]** Photography Captures the Moments. Video Tells the Story.

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** Your event produces energy, voices, and moments that still images alone can't fully communicate. Event Video Systems turn your event into professional video content — highlight reels that capture the atmosphere, testimonial interviews that let your audience speak for themselves, leadership messaging that lives for months, and social-ready clips your team can post before the event is even over. Each system is designed around what you're trying to accomplish — not around production complexity.

**\[Secondary Context Line\]** Not sure which video system fits your event? Start with what you want to walk away with — we'll help you choose the right approach.

**\[Primary CTA Button\]** Talk With Our Team

**\[Secondary CTA Button\]** Check Availability

### **Image Direction**

**\[IMAGE — Hero\]** The hero image should show video production in the context of a live event — a videographer capturing a keynote, a speaker on stage with professional video equipment visible but not dominant, or an interview setup in a convention environment. The image should communicate STORY, PROFESSIONALISM, and INTEGRATION — video happening naturally within an event, not a production that takes over the room.

If a secondary image strip is used: show 2–3 different video outputs — a highlight reel frame, a testimonial interview setup, and a vertical social clip on a phone. This communicates the range of what the systems produce.

### **Implementation Notes**

* The headline establishes the relationship between photography and video immediately — not competitive, complementary. Photography captures moments. Video tells the story.  
* The secondary context line directly addresses the most common visitor state: "I know I need video but I don't know what kind." It signals that the page will help them decide.  
* Hero should feel cinematic but accessible. The visitor should feel like video is achievable and clear, not overwhelming or technically complex.

## **SECTION 2: The Problem (Empathy \+ Villain)**

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** The Video Question

**\[H2 Heading\]** You Know You Need Video. You're Just Not Sure What Kind.

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** Every event planner has the same conversation at some point: "We should really have video this year." But then the questions start. What kind of video? How long? What's the difference between a highlight reel and a testimonial package? Do we need interviews? What about social media content? And before you know it, the conversation stalls because the options feel unclear and the terminology feels unfamiliar.

**\[Supporting Line\]** You don't need to understand video production. You just need to know what you want to walk away with. That's where we start.

### **Image Direction**

**\[IMAGE — Optional\]** Skip the image on this section — the copy carries it. If an image is needed for layout balance, a simple abstract visual or a subtle background treatment works. No specific photo needed.

### **Implementation Notes**

* This section names the villain differently than the other service pages. The villain here isn't "bad video" or "wasted investment" — it's **confusion about options**. The planner's uncertainty isn't about quality, it's about selection. They don't know what to ask for.  
* The supporting line is the most important sentence on the page. It reframes the entire conversation from "what kind of video production do you need?" to "what do you want to walk away with?" This is the language shift that makes video accessible to non-production buyers.  
* Keep this section tight — it sets up the selection guide.

---

## **SECTION 3: The Selection Guide — "What Do You Want to Walk Away With?"**

This is the core of the page. It helps the visitor self-select by starting with their desired outcome, not with production terminology. Each outcome maps to a specific video system. The visitor should be able to scan this section and immediately identify which system fits their event.

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** Find Your Fit

**\[H2 Heading\]** Start With What You Want. We'll Handle How It Gets Made.

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** Every event has a story worth capturing on video. The right system depends on what you want that video to accomplish after the event ends. Here are the four most common outcomes — and the system designed to deliver each one.

**\[Selection Cards — Outcome-First Format\]**

---

**\[Card 1\]**

**\[Outcome Statement\]** "I want a polished recap that captures the energy of my event."

**\[System Name\]** Event Highlight System™

**\[One-Line Description\]** A professionally edited highlight video that captures the atmosphere, the key moments, and the story of your event — typically delivered as a 1–2 minute recap your marketing team uses for months.

**\[Best For\]** Post-event marketing · Membership communications · Social media · Event promotion · Sponsor deliverables · Website content

**\[Learn More →\]** anchor link to Section 4 detail block

---

**\[Card 2\]**

**\[Outcome Statement\]** "I want the energy AND the voices — attendees and speakers telling the story themselves."

**\[System Name\]** Event Highlight \+ Vox System™

**\[One-Line Description\]** Everything in the Highlight System, plus on-site interviews with attendees, speakers, or members. The testimonial voices give your video authenticity and emotional weight that a recap alone can't deliver.

**\[Best For\]** Member-driven content · Recruiting · Attendee testimonials · Speaker features · Association marketing · Culture storytelling

**\[Learn More →\]** anchor link to Section 4 detail block

---

**\[Card 3\]**

**\[Outcome Statement\]** "I want my leadership team's message captured professionally — content we'll use for a year or more."

**\[System Name\]** Executive Story System™

**\[One-Line Description\]** A dedicated, multi-camera interview production that captures executive messaging, company vision, and leadership storytelling. This is evergreen brand content — not event documentation — designed to serve recruiting, investor communications, and organizational storytelling for 12–18 months.

**\[Best For\]** CEO / leadership messaging · Recruiting content · Investor relations · Company milestones · Brand storytelling · Internal communications

**\[Learn More →\]** anchor link to Section 4 detail block

---

**\[Card 4 — Enhancement Layer\]**

**\[Outcome Statement\]** "I want content my team can post while the event is still happening."

**\[System Name\]** Social Recap System™

**\[Label Badge\]** Add to Any Engagement

**\[One-Line Description\]** Rapid-turn vertical video optimized for Instagram Reels, TikTok, and Stories — delivered within 48 hours or same-day when bundled with another video system. This is the real-time social layer that keeps your event trending while it's still happening.

**\[Best For\]** Real-time social media · Instagram Reels · TikTok · Stories · Event buzz · Brand visibility during live events

**\[Learn More →\]** anchor link to Section 5 (Social Recap dedicated section)

---

### **Implementation Notes**

* These four cards should be visually prominent — this is the section that does the actual "guiding." Use a card grid (2x2 on desktop, stacked on mobile) or a vertical stack with clear visual separation.  
* The outcome statements (in quotes) are the primary scanning element. They should be the largest text on each card. A visitor should be able to read ONLY the four outcome statements and know which system they need.  
* Card 4 (Social Recap) should be visually differentiated from the other three — a subtle badge, different background shade, or "Add to Any Engagement" label — to signal that it's an enhancement layer, not a peer option.  
* Each "Learn More" link anchor-scrolls to the detailed description in Section 4 (or Section 5 for Social Recap). This keeps the selection guide scannable while providing depth below.  
* This section is the highest-value SEO/GEO extraction target on the page. AI search engines answering "what kind of event video do I need?" will pull from these outcome-to-system mappings.

---

## **SECTION 4: Video System Details — The Full Picture**

This section provides the detailed description of each core video system. Visitors who identified their system in Section 3 scroll here to confirm and learn more. Each block answers: What is it? What does it include? When is it the right choice?

### **Copy**

**\[H2 Heading\]** A Closer Look at Each System

---

**\[System Block 1: Event Highlight System™\]**

**\[Anchor ID\]** event-highlight-system

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** Event Highlight System™

**\[Block Heading\]** The Event Recap Your Marketing Team Actually Uses

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** The Event Highlight System captures the energy and narrative arc of your event in a professionally edited video — typically 1–2 minutes — that your team uses across marketing, social media, membership communications, and event promotion. We deploy strategic coverage across keynotes, general sessions, high-energy moments, and attendee interaction, then edit it into a polished recap with licensed music, color grading, and your branding.

This is the video your organization shares to show what the event felt like — and to sell next year's event before this one fades from memory.

**\[What's Included — Short List\]**

* Strategic B-roll coverage across keynotes, sessions, and high-energy moments  
* Professionally edited 1–2 minute highlight video  
* Licensed music and sound design  
* Color grading and motion graphics (logo/branding)  
* HD/4K delivery formats  
* Standard Commercial License  
* Delivery: 21 business days

**\[When This Is the Right Choice\]**

* You want a post-event recap for marketing and social media  
* Your convention or conference needs a "sizzle reel" that captures the energy  
* You want content to promote next year's event  
* Sponsors need video assets as part of their deliverable package  
* You need a visual summary for membership or stakeholder communications

**\[System Block 2: Event Highlight \+ Vox System™\]**

**\[Anchor ID\]** event-highlight-vox-system

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** Event Highlight \+ Vox System™

**\[Block Heading\]** The Recap That Lets Your Audience Tell the Story

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** Everything in the Event Highlight System — plus on-site interviews that capture the voices of your attendees, speakers, and members. "Vox" interviews are short, authentic, on-the-floor conversations: What brought you here? What was the highlight? What are you taking home? These testimonial moments give your video emotional weight and credibility that a music-and-B-roll recap alone can't match.

When your audience tells the story in their own words, the content feels real. That's what makes it work for recruiting, membership growth, and organizational storytelling — not just event marketing.

**\[What's Included — Short List\]**

* Everything in Event Highlight System™  
* Up to 4 on-site interviews (testimonial / man-on-the-street style)  
* Professional audio engineering for voice capture  
* Interview integration with B-roll storytelling  
* HD/4K delivery formats  
* Standard Commercial License  
* Delivery: 21 business days  
* Additional interviews available in pairs

**\[When This Is the Right Choice\]**

* You want attendee testimonials that feel authentic, not scripted  
* Your association or membership organization needs "real voices" content  
* You're producing recruiting or culture content and want employee or attendee perspectives  
* Speakers or presenters deserve featured moments beyond just stage coverage  
* You want the emotional impact of people describing what the event meant to them

**\[System Block 3: Executive Story System™\]**

**\[Anchor ID\]** executive-story-system

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** Executive Story System™

**\[Block Heading\]** Leadership Messaging That Lives for a Year

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** The Executive Story System is not event documentation — it's a dedicated brand content production. Multi-camera sit-down interviews with your leadership team, professional audio engineering, controlled lighting, and strategic brand-focused B-roll. The result is evergreen executive messaging content your organization uses for 12–18 months: recruiting videos, investor communications, company updates, leadership introductions, and brand storytelling.

This is the content your CEO records once and your marketing team deploys across channels for the next year. If your leadership is already on-site for a convention or corporate event, that's the ideal time to capture it — no additional travel, no separate scheduling, no pulling executives away from their day.

**\[What's Included — Short List\]**

* Multi-camera sit-down interview production (2-camera setup)  
* Professional audio engineering with lavalier and boom microphones  
* Controlled lighting and branded interview environment  
* Strategic brand-focused B-roll (facilities, culture, operations, products)  
* Licensed music and sound design  
* Deliverable options: full-length interviews (3–5 min), standalone social clips (30–90 sec), integrated story video (5–7 min)  
* HD/4K delivery formats  
* Standard Commercial License  
* Delivery: 21 business days

**\[When This Is the Right Choice\]**

* Your CEO or leadership team wants to communicate company vision, values, or direction  
* HR needs professional recruiting content that showcases culture and leadership  
* You're approaching a company milestone, leadership transition, or strategic shift  
* Your leadership team is already on-site for a convention or corporate event — capture it while they're there  
* You want evergreen brand content that doesn't expire after the event ends

**\[Pairs Best With\]** [Convention Media Services](https://claude.ai/services/convention-media) · [Executive Imaging™](https://claude.ai/services/executive-imaging) (update headshots while leadership is on-site) · Event Highlight System™ (upgrade event coverage to include evergreen leadership content)

**\[Future Page Note — Internal Only\]** Executive Story System is flagged for a future dedicated service page. When that page is built, this block should link to it and this section should be condensed to a summary with a "Learn More" link. For now, the full detail lives here.

---

### **Image Direction**

**\[IMAGE — Per System Block (Recommended)\]**

* Event Highlight System: A frame from a highlight reel — keynote moment, event energy, polished and cinematic.  
* Event Highlight \+ Vox System: An on-site interview in progress — someone speaking naturally with a convention environment visible behind them. Authentic, not staged.  
* Executive Story System: A multi-camera interview setup — controlled environment, professional lighting, executive subject. Should feel premium and intentional.

### **Interaction Recommendations**

**\[INTERACTION — Staggered Reveal\]** Each system block reveals on scroll. If using anchor links from Section 3, the scroll-to behavior should be smooth with appropriate offset for sticky navigation.

### **Implementation Notes**

* These three blocks are the detailed counterparts to the Section 3 selection cards. They should feel like deeper dives, not repetitions.  
* The "When This Is the Right Choice" sections are critical — they give the visitor permission to confirm their selection. Each one should feel like a checklist they can mentally check off.  
* The "Pairs Best With" line at the bottom of each block connects video back to photography services — reinforcing the integrated media system positioning.  
* No pricing on this page. Investment discussions happen in the strategy call.  
* The Executive Story System block should be slightly longer than the other two because it requires more education — visitors are less likely to know what this is compared to a "highlight reel."

## **SECTION 5: Social Recap System™ — The Real-Time Layer**

Social Recap gets its own section, visually differentiated from the three core systems, because it operates differently. It's not a standalone video production — it's the real-time social content layer that enhances any video or photography engagement.

### **Copy**

**\[Anchor ID\]** social-recap-system

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** Add to Any Engagement

**\[H2 Heading\]** Social Recap System™ — Content Your Team Posts While the Event Is Still Happening

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** The three core video systems produce content you use after the event. Social Recap System produces content you use during it. A dedicated content creator captures vertical video optimized for Instagram Reels, TikTok, and Stories — short, high-energy clips edited with trending audio and social-first pacing. Your marketing team gets content they can post while the event is still trending, extending your reach and visibility in real time.

Social Recap layers onto any JHR engagement. Add it to a video system for same-day highlights. Add it to a photography service for social video alongside your still coverage. It works with everything because it's designed to complement, not compete.

**\[What's Included — Short List\]**

* On-site content capture optimized for social sharing  
* Vertical (9:16) and square (1:1) formats  
* Up to 4 short-form videos (30–60 seconds each)  
* Trending audio and social-first editing  
* Designed for Instagram Reels, TikTok, and Stories  
* Delivery: 48 hours (same-day highlights available when bundled with video systems)

**\[When to Add Social Recap\]**

* Your event has strong visual energy — parties, activations, brand experiences, packed sessions  
* Your marketing team wants to post during the event, not just after  
* You're producing a convention or trade show and want social momentum on the floor  
* Your audience skews toward platforms where short-form video drives engagement  
* You want to extend your event's reach beyond the room while it's still happening

**\[Layers Onto\]** Event Highlight System™ · Event Highlight \+ Vox System™ · Executive Story System™ · [Convention Media Services](https://claude.ai/services/convention-media) · [Trade-Show Media Services](https://claude.ai/services/trade-show-media)

### **Image Direction**

**\[IMAGE\]** Show a phone screen displaying a vertical video clip from an event — ideally mid-play, with Instagram or TikTok UI visible. This communicates the end product in its native format. Alternatively, show a content creator capturing vertical video on a show floor or at a convention.

### **Implementation Notes**

* This section should be visually differentiated from Section 4 — different background treatment, a badge or label that says "Add to Any Engagement," or a container style that signals "this is an enhancement, not a fourth option."  
* The "Layers Onto" line at the bottom replaces the "Pairs Best With" used in the core systems — reinforcing that Social Recap is additive, not standalone (even though it technically can be deployed standalone, the page should lead with the enhancement framing).  
* No pricing on this page.

---

## **SECTION 6: How Video and Photography Work Together**

This section reinforces the integrated media system positioning — that video and photography are two halves of the same engagement, not separate purchases. It also helps visitors who arrived from a photography service page understand how to add video to what they're already planning.

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** The Complete System

**\[H2 Heading\]** Video Isn't an Add-On. It's the Other Half of Your Event Media.

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** When you pair photography and video, your event produces two kinds of content that serve different purposes for different audiences over different timescales. Photography gives you the asset library — the images your team uses across marketing, sponsors, internal comms, and social. Video gives you the story — the energy, the voices, and the narrative that brings the event to life long after it ends.

Together, they're a complete media system. Here's how our photography and video services work together.

**\[Pairing Guide — Structured Blocks or Table\]**

| Your Photography Service | Recommended Video Pairing | What You Get Together |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| [Convention Media Services](https://claude.ai/services/convention-media) | Event Highlight System™ or Event Highlight \+ Vox System™ | A complete asset library (photos) plus a polished recap or testimonial video that your marketing, membership, and sponsor teams use all year |
| [Trade-Show Media Services](https://claude.ai/services/trade-show-media) | Event Highlight \+ Vox System™ \+ Social Recap System™ | Show floor documentation (photos) plus floor-energy video with exhibitor/attendee testimonials and real-time social clips |
| Corporate Event Media \[LINK-FUTURE\] | Event Highlight System™ or Executive Story System™ | Event documentation (photos) plus a recap video or evergreen leadership content captured while executives are on-site |
| [Executive Imaging™](https://claude.ai/services/executive-imaging) | Executive Story System™ | Updated leadership headshots (photos) plus professional video interviews — your executives' visual and verbal brand captured in one session |

### **Implementation Notes**

* This table is a high-value SEO/GEO asset — it answers the common search query "do I need both photography and video for my event?" with a structured, extractable answer.  
* The table can be rendered as cards, a responsive HTML table, or a visual pairing graphic. Whichever matches the design system.  
* The Corporate Event Media row uses a future-link placeholder. When that page is built, the link activates.  
* This section should feel like practical guidance, not a sales pitch. The tone is: "Here's how these things actually work together."

---

## **SECTION 7: What's Included Across All Video Systems**

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** Standard With Every System

**\[H2 Heading\]** Professional Quality. Clear Delivery. No Surprises.

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** Regardless of which video system you choose, every engagement includes the same professional standards, licensing, and delivery commitments. Here's what you can expect.

**\[Included Items — Clean List or Grid\]**

* **Professional Videography** — Certified operators who understand event pacing, staging, and how to capture content without disrupting your program.  
* **Professional Post-Production** — Color grading, sound design, licensed music, motion graphics, and your branding integrated into every deliverable.  
* **HD/4K Delivery** — All video delivered in high-definition and 4K formats, ready for any platform or use case.  
* **Standard Commercial License** — Every deliverable is commercially licensed for your website, social media, internal communications, and partner sharing. Extended licensing available for broadcast and paid advertising.  
* **21 Business Day Delivery** — Standard across all video systems (48-hour for Social Recap). Clear timeline commitments, not open-ended production cycles.  
* **Final Frame Guarantee™** — Every delivered video meets JHR's professional quality standard. The same commitment we make on photography applies to every frame of video.

### **Implementation Notes**

* Present as a clean grid (2 columns on desktop) or a visually structured list.  
* This section exists to answer "What's the baseline I can count on?" — it reassures the visitor that quality and delivery are consistent regardless of which system they choose.  
* No pricing on this page.

## **SECTION 8: Social Proof — Video-Specific Testimonials**

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** The Results

**\[H2 Heading\]** What Happens When Your Event Has a Story to Tell

**\[PLACEHOLDER — Testimonial 1: Convention or Conference Client\]** Quote should reference: how the highlight video extended the event's value, how sponsors or members responded to the video content, or how the organization used the video for marketing or membership growth after the event.

Attribution:

* Name, Title  
* Organization Type: Association / Convention Organizer / Agency  
* Event Name (if permissible)

**\[PLACEHOLDER — Testimonial 2: Client Who Used Vox Interviews or Executive Story\]** Quote should reference: the impact of real voices in the content, how testimonial or leadership video changed their marketing, or how the evergreen content continued performing months after production.

Attribution:

* Name, Title  
* Organization Type: Enterprise / Association / Marketing Leader  
* Event or Production Context

**\[PLACEHOLDER — Testimonial 3: Client Who Paired Video \+ Photography (Optional)\]** Quote should reference: the value of the complete media system, how having both photography and video from one partner simplified their workflow, or how the combined content served multiple teams and purposes.

Attribution:

* Name, Title  
* Organization Type  
* Event Name (if permissible)

### **Implementation Notes**

* 2–3 testimonials. Same card format as homepage and other service pages.  
* If only 2 strong testimonials exist, use 2\.  
* A testimonial specifically about the photography \+ video pairing would powerfully reinforce Section 6\.  
* A testimonial about Executive Story System performing as evergreen content months after capture would validate the "12–18 months" promise.

## **SECTION 9: FAQ — Event Video Systems**

These FAQs are specific to the Event Video Systems page. They address real questions about video selection, production logistics, pairing with photography, and delivery expectations.

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** Common Questions

**\[H2 Heading\]** Event Video Systems FAQs

---

**Q: I know I need video for my event but I'm not sure which system to choose. How do I decide?**

A: Start with what you want to walk away with. If you want a polished recap that captures the energy of your event, that's the Event Highlight System. If you want that recap plus real voices — attendees, speakers, or members sharing their experience — that's the Event Highlight \+ Vox System. If you want professional leadership messaging content that your organization uses for a year or more, that's the Executive Story System. And if you want content your team can post on social media while the event is still happening, add the Social Recap System to any engagement. If you're still unsure, that's exactly what our planning conversation is for — tell us about your event and what you're trying to accomplish, and we'll recommend the right system.

---

**Q: What's the difference between the Event Highlight System and Event Highlight \+ Vox System?**

A: The Event Highlight System is a professionally edited recap video — B-roll footage of your event set to licensed music with your branding. It captures the energy and atmosphere. The Event Highlight \+ Vox System includes everything in the Highlight System plus on-site interviews — short, authentic conversations with attendees, speakers, or members that add real voices to the story. The Vox interviews give the video emotional depth and credibility. If your content needs to feel personal and authentic — for recruiting, membership growth, or organizational storytelling — the Vox System is the stronger choice.

---

**Q: How is the Executive Story System different from event video?**

A: The Executive Story System is a dedicated brand content production, not event documentation. It uses a multi-camera interview setup, professional audio engineering, and controlled lighting to capture leadership messaging — company vision, CEO updates, recruiting stories, brand narratives. The other systems capture what happens at your event. Executive Story captures what your leaders want to say. The content is evergreen — designed to serve your organization for 12–18 months across recruiting, investor communications, and marketing. If your leadership team is already on-site for a convention or corporate event, that's the ideal time to capture it without additional scheduling.

---

**Q: Can I add Social Recap to a photography-only engagement?**

A: Yes. Social Recap System layers onto any JHR engagement — video or photography. If you've booked [Convention Media Services](https://claude.ai/services/convention-media) or [Trade-Show Media Services](https://claude.ai/services/trade-show-media) and want real-time social video alongside your still photography, Social Recap adds a dedicated content creator who captures vertical video optimized for Instagram Reels, TikTok, and Stories. It's the fastest way to extend your event's reach while it's still happening.

---

**Q: Should I book video alongside photography, or can I add it later?**

A: We strongly recommend planning video and photography together from the start. When both are part of the same engagement, our team coordinates coverage so nothing gets missed and the content works together as a complete system. Adding video after photography is booked is possible — but the earlier we plan together, the better the result. Video isn't an afterthought — it's the other half of your event media strategy.

---

**Q: How long is the final video?**

A: The Event Highlight System and Event Highlight \+ Vox System typically produce a 1–2 minute recap video — optimized for attention and shareability. The Executive Story System produces multiple deliverables: full-length interviews (3–5 minutes each), standalone social clips (30–90 seconds), and an integrated story video (5–7 minutes). Social Recap System produces up to 4 short-form videos at 30–60 seconds each. Every deliverable is designed around how your audience will actually consume it — not around maximizing runtime.

---

**Q: What does "strategic coverage" mean for multi-day events?**

A: For multi-day events, we deploy strategic coverage — typically focused on opening sessions, keynotes, primary programming, sponsor activations, and attendee energy. We capture the narrative arc of your event efficiently rather than filming continuously for eight hours a day. This approach produces a stronger final video because it focuses on the moments that matter. If your event requires continuous documentation of all concurrent sessions, that's a different scope — we'll discuss it during planning and recommend the right approach.

**Q: What's the delivery timeline?**

A: Standard delivery is 21 business days for all core video systems (Event Highlight, Event Highlight \+ Vox, and Executive Story). Social Recap System delivers within 48 hours — with same-day highlights available when bundled with another video system. If you need faster turnaround on core systems, talk with our team about availability — expedited timelines are sometimes possible depending on production schedules.

---

**Q: Can I use the videos for paid advertising or broadcast?**

A: All video systems include a Standard Commercial License that covers your website, social media, internal presentations, sponsor sharing, and member communications. If you need broadcast television, paid digital advertising, or sublicensing rights, that's covered under an Extended License — we can discuss pricing and terms during your planning conversation.

---

**Q: Do I need to provide anything for the interviews in the Vox System or Executive Story System?**

A: For Vox interviews (man-on-the-street style), we handle everything — our team identifies willing participants on the floor, guides the conversation, and captures the audio and video. You don't need to recruit interviewees or prepare questions, though you can suggest topics or people if you'd like. For Executive Story System interviews, we'll collaborate on talking points and themes during planning so your leadership feels prepared and the content aligns with your messaging goals. In both cases, we bring all production equipment and handle the process.

### **Implementation Notes**

* FAQs should be collapsible/accordion style — heading visible, body expands on click.  
* Place after testimonials and before the final CTA.  
* The first FAQ ("how do I decide") is the most important — it recaps the entire selection framework in conversational language. AI search engines will extract this for "which event video service should I choose" queries.  
* The "strategic coverage" FAQ proactively sets expectations for multi-day events — preventing scope confusion before it happens.  
* Links within FAQ answers should point to existing service pages where available.  
* FAQ schema markup (JSON-LD) should be added for SEO.

## **SECTION 10: Final CTA**

### **Copy**

**\[Micro-Tagline\]** Event Video Systems™ — Professional event video for Nashville conventions, conferences, and corporate events

**\[H2 Heading\]** Tell Us What You Want to Walk Away With. We'll Build the Right System.

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** Tell us about your event — the format, the scale, and what you want the video to accomplish afterward. We'll recommend the right video system, show you how it pairs with your photography coverage, and give you a clear picture of what to expect.

**\[Primary CTA Button\]** Talk With Our Team

**\[Secondary CTA Button\]** Check Availability

### **Implementation Notes**

* Dark gradient background. Same treatment as homepage and services hub final CTAs.  
* Micro-tagline positions the service name and Nashville context for SEO reinforcement.  
* The headline echoes the selection guide framing — "what you want to walk away with" — creating a consistent thread from hero to final CTA.

## **Internal Service Cross-Link Architecture**

| Linked Service | Route | Link Appears In |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Convention Media Services | /services/convention-media | Section 4 (pairings), Section 6 (pairing table), FAQ |
| Trade-Show Media Services™ | /services/trade-show-media | Section 4 (pairings), Section 5, Section 6 (pairing table), FAQ |
| Executive Imaging™ | /services/executive-imaging | Section 4 (Executive Story pairing) |
| Corporate Event Media | \[LINK-FUTURE\] | Section 6 (pairing table) |
| Headshot Activation™ | /services/headshot-activation | — (no direct cross-link on this page) |

**Note:** Headshot Activation does not pair with video services and should not be cross-linked on this page.

## **Future Page Flag: Executive Story System™**

Executive Story System is flagged for a future dedicated service page. When that page is built:

* **New route:** /services/executive-story-system (or similar)  
* **This page update:** Section 4's Executive Story block should be condensed to a summary card with a "Learn More" link pointing to the dedicated page  
* **Cross-link updates:** Convention Media, Executive Imaging, and any other pages referencing Executive Story should point to the new dedicated page instead of anchor-linking to this page  
* **The dedicated page should cover:** Multi-camera production details, the difference between event video and brand production, use cases for recruiting/investor/leadership messaging, the "your leaders are already on-site" pairing opportunity, and its own FAQ section

## **SEO / GEO Strategy Notes**

**Primary Keywords (Natural Integration):**

* Event video Nashville  
* Convention video production Nashville  
* Event highlight video  
* Corporate event video services  
* Testimonial video Nashville  
* Executive interview video  
* Event recap video Nashville

**Entity Nesting (For AI Search):** Naturally group: "Event Video Systems™," "Event Highlight System™," "Event Highlight \+ Vox System™," "Executive Story System™," "Social Recap System™," "Nashville Convention Video," "Final Frame Guarantee™"

**Snippet Bait:** The Selection Guide (Section 3\) is the highest-value extraction target. AI search engines answering "what kind of event video do I need?" or "event highlight video vs testimonial video" will pull directly from the outcome-to-system mappings.

**Citation Bait:** The "start with what you want to walk away with" framework — guiding video selection by outcome rather than production terminology — is a specific, accessible insight that AI models will favor over competitors who lead with technical specs.

## **Copy Quality Checklist**

1. ✅ Page functions as both a **service destination** and a **selection guide** — educating visitors who don't know which video system they need  
2. ✅ Three core video systems presented as **equal tiers** with clear differentiation  
3. ✅ Social Recap positioned as an **enhancement layer**, not a fourth peer option  
4. ✅ Executive Story System included with **full detail** but flagged for a future dedicated page  
5. ✅ Selection is guided by **desired outcome** ("what do you want to walk away with?"), not production terminology  
6. ✅ Video is framed as **completion of the media system**, never as an add-on to photography  
7. ✅ Photography pairing table connects video to every photography service naturally  
8. ✅ JHR is the Guide — the planner is the Hero  
9. ✅ The villain is **confusion about options**, not bad video or wasted investment  
10. ✅ No production jargon, hourly rates, or equipment specs (except where necessary for Executive Story differentiation)  
11. ✅ FAQs address real selection questions, delivery logistics, and pairing guidance  
12. ✅ CTAs are "Talk With Our Team" or "Check Availability"  
13. ✅ The page answers: "I know I need video but I don't know which kind" — CLEARLY AND CONFIDENTLY
