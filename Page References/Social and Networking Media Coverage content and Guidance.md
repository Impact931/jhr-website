# **JHR Photography — Social & Networking Media \- Service Page Copy & Implementation Guide**

**Document Purpose:** Provide finalized copy for a NEW service page at /services/social-networking-media. This page does not currently exist and should be added to the site navigation under Services. The service targets organizations running shorter, recurring social events — networking mixers, cocktail meetups, association gatherings, and professional community events — where fast-turn, social-first media creates immediate value on a practical budget.

**Important for Agent:** This is a NEW PAGE. Create it using the existing service page component structure (matching /services/headshot-activation, /services/corporate-event-coverage, etc.). Apply copy to the same element patterns. Add this page to the Services navigation and footer service list.

## **Page Strategy: The "Quick Win" Service**

This is JHR's most accessible service — shorter engagements, faster delivery, and a price point that works for organizations operating on tighter event budgets. But "accessible" doesn't mean "lesser." The value proposition is sharp: same-day content that puts the client's event on attendees' social feeds while the energy is still fresh.

**What makes this service distinct:**

* Short-duration events (2–4 hours, single evening)  
* Same-day highlight delivery for immediate social posting  
* 2 Instagram Reels produced and delivered rapidly  
* Full curated gallery within 24 hours  
* The primary value is SOCIAL AMPLIFICATION — attendees reshare, the client's brand reaches networks they couldn't access through their own channels  
* Recurring relationships are central — these organizations hold events monthly or quarterly

**What this page does NOT cover:**

* Multi-day conference coverage → Corporate Event Coverage™  
* Trade show floor documentation → Trade-Show Media Services™  
* Headshot activations at booths → Headshot Activation™  
* Produced video systems (highlight reels, executive stories) → Event Video Systems™

**Primary Audience: Community & Professional Organization Leaders** Events coordinators, marketing leads, and executive directors at chambers of commerce, entrepreneur centers, young professional groups, alumni associations, and industry organizations. They run recurring events on practical budgets and need media that proves their events are vibrant, well-attended, and worth showing up to.

**Secondary Audience: Corporate Event Planners with Social Components** Planners who are booking Corporate Event Coverage for a larger event and want to add dedicated social event coverage for receptions, happy hours, or dinners. This page serves them too, but the primary framing is for the standalone short-event buyer.

**The UGC Play:** The most valuable short-term outcome of this service isn't the gallery — it's what happens when attendees post. When guests share their photos and the event reels on their own LinkedIn, Instagram, and social accounts, the client's brand reaches professional networks organically. JHR posts in support of the client, but the real amplification comes from the room. The copy positions this as the core value, not an afterthought.

**The Recurring Relationship:** Organizations like the Chamber of Commerce, Entrepreneur Center, and professional associations don't hold one event a year — they hold events monthly or quarterly. This service is built for that rhythm. The copy plants the recurring partnership angle early and reinforces it in the FAQ.

## **Document Conventions**

* `[COPY]` \= Finalized text. Apply directly.  
* `[ELEMENT]` \= HTML element type or component role.  
* `[IMAGE]` \= Image placement with art direction notes.  
* `[INTERACTION]` \= Scroll animation or dynamic behavior recommendation.  
* `[STYLE NOTE]` \= CSS/styling suggestion.

---

## **Navigation Update**

**Add to Services menu and footer (in this position):**

* Headshot Activation  
* Corporate Event Coverage  
* **Social & Networking Media** ← new  
* Corporate Headshot Program  
* Event Video Systems

Position it after Corporate Event Coverage because it naturally extends from that service (social components of larger events) while also standing alone for the short-event buyer.

## **SECTION 1: Page Hero**

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** Social & Networking Media Package™

**\[H1 Headline\]** Your Event Should Still Be Trending the Next Morning

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** Networking events, cocktail mixers, association meetups, and community gatherings move fast — and the best content from the night has a short shelf life. We capture the energy, the connections, and the moments that matter, then deliver same-day highlights and ready-to-post reels so your event reaches far beyond the room while it's still fresh.

**\[Secondary Context Line\]** Fast-turn photography and social video for professional networking events, community gatherings, cocktail hours, and organizational meetups — designed for immediate social impact.

**\[Primary CTA Button\]** Talk With Our Team

**\[Secondary CTA Button\]** Check Availability

### **Image Direction**

**\[IMAGE — Hero\]** A vibrant networking event in progress — professional but energetic. Think: a well-attended cocktail mixer at a Nashville venue, people engaged in conversation, warm lighting, visible brand signage from the hosting organization. The image should feel social, alive, and professional — not corporate-stiff and not party-casual. The sweet spot is "professionals enjoying themselves at a well-run event."

### **Implementation Notes**

* The tone of this page is slightly warmer and more energetic than Corporate Event Coverage — this is the social side of professional events. But it's still JHR voice: confident, experienced, professional. Not hype-driven.  
* Headline focuses on the outcome (event trending, social reach) rather than the service mechanics.

---

## **SECTION 2: The Problem (Empathy \+ Villain)**

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** The Missed Opportunity

**\[H2 Heading\]** Great Events Deserve More Than a Few Phone Photos

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** Your organization puts real effort into bringing people together — the venue, the speakers, the sponsors, the coordination. But when the only photos from the night are grainy phone shots from someone's pocket, the event looks smaller than it was. Your sponsors don't see themselves represented. Your social channels go quiet. And the people who weren't there have no reason to show up next time.

**\[Supporting Line\]** Professional media turns a Tuesday night meetup into proof that your organization is the place to be.

### **Implementation Notes**

* The villain here is INVISIBLE EVENTS — great gatherings that leave no professional trace. The organization can't prove the value of the event to sponsors, members, or prospective attendees because the media doesn't exist or doesn't look professional.  
* This is empathetic, not dramatic. The tone is: "We know this event mattered. Let's make sure it looks like it did."

---

## **SECTION 3: The Solution — What You Get**

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** What We Deliver

**\[H2 Heading\]** Same-Day Content That Puts Your Event on the Feed

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** We show up, capture the energy, and deliver content fast enough to matter. Here's what your organization walks away with — typically before the night is over.

**\[Deliverable Block 1: Same-Day Highlights\]**

**Heading:** Same-Day Photo Highlights **Body:** 5–10 curated, professionally shot images delivered the same evening — ready to post on your social channels, share with sponsors, and send to attendees while the event is still the freshest thing on their feed. No waiting days for a gallery. Your marketing team has content before they leave the venue.

**\[Deliverable Block 2: Instagram Reels\]**

**Heading:** 2 Instagram Reels — Produced On-Site **Body:** Short-form video content captured and assembled during your event — designed for Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, and Stories. These aren't afterthought clips. They're intentionally produced to show the energy, the people, and the brand in a format that gets shared. This is the content that makes people who weren't there wish they had been.

**\[Deliverable Block 3: Full Curated Gallery\]**

**Heading:** Full Event Gallery — 24-Hour Delivery **Body:** Your complete curated gallery — every professional image from the evening — delivered within 24 hours. Event branding, sponsor visibility, speaker moments, candid interactions, and group photos, all organized and ready for your marketing collateral, member communications, and organizational reporting.

**\[Deliverable Block 4: The Amplification Effect\]**

**Heading:** Content People Actually Share **Body:** Here's where the real value lands. When you deliver professional photos from the event to your attendees, they post them. On LinkedIn. On Instagram. On their company pages. Every share puts your organization's event — and your sponsors' brands — in front of professional networks you couldn't reach on your own. That's organic amplification that no ad budget can replicate. We shoot with this in mind. Every image is composed to be shareable, taggable, and worth posting.

### **Image Direction**

**\[IMAGE — Per Deliverable Block (Recommended)\]**

* Same-Day Highlights: A phone or laptop screen showing freshly delivered event photos — or a social media post going live with event imagery.  
* Instagram Reels: A still frame from a reel — dynamic, vertical format, showing event energy in a social-native format.  
* Full Gallery: A gallery view showing the breadth of coverage — multiple thumbnails from a single event.  
* Amplification: A LinkedIn or Instagram post from an attendee sharing an event photo. If a real example exists, use it. This is the most powerful proof point on the page.

### **Interaction Recommendations**

**\[INTERACTION — Staggered Reveal\]** Deliverable blocks reveal on scroll, staggered 150ms apart. The Amplification block should feel like the payoff — slightly more visual weight or a different background treatment to signal "this is the point."

---

## **SECTION 4: Who This Is For**

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** Built For

**\[H2 Heading\]** The Organizations That Bring People Together

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** If your organization hosts regular professional gatherings — monthly, quarterly, or seasonally — this service is designed for the way you work. Short events, practical budgets, and content that proves the value of showing up.

---

**\[Org Type 1\]**

**Heading:** Chambers of Commerce & Business Associations **Body:** Monthly luncheons, quarterly mixers, annual galas, and member appreciation events. Your members and sponsors need to see themselves represented professionally — and prospective members need to see what they're missing. Consistent, professional media from every event builds the case for membership and sponsorship renewal without you having to make the pitch.

---

**\[Org Type 2\]**

**Heading:** Entrepreneur Centers & Startup Communities **Body:** Demo nights, pitch events, founder meetups, and community programming. The energy in these rooms is real — the media should match it. Professional coverage gives your ecosystem visibility, attracts new founders, and shows sponsors and grant funders that their investment is landing in a room full of momentum.

---

**\[Org Type 3\]**

**Heading:** Young Professional & Industry Organizations **Body:** Happy hours, panel discussions, professional development nights, and social mixers. These events live and die by attendance — and attendance is driven by what people see on social media afterward. When the photos from last month's event look sharp, next month's RSVP list grows.

---

**\[Org Type 4\]**

**Heading:** Alumni Associations & Collegiate Groups **Body:** Reunion events, networking receptions, mentorship programs, and chapter gatherings. These events strengthen the connection between your institution and its graduates. Professional media gives your communications team content that reinforces belonging, pride, and ongoing engagement.

---

**\[Org Type 5\]**

**Heading:** Pre-Event Receptions & Conference Socials **Body:** If you're hosting a larger conference or corporate event and the evening social is its own production — a welcome reception, a sponsor dinner, an awards cocktail — this package covers that component with the fast-turn, social-first approach it deserves. Pairs naturally with [Corporate Event Coverage™](https://claude.ai/services/corporate-event-coverage) for full-program documentation.

---

### **Implementation Notes**

* Each org type: heading \+ short paragraph. Optional small image or icon.  
* Keep these concise — they're identification moments, not deep dives. The planner reads the one that matches them and thinks "yes, they get it."  
* The final type (Pre-Event Receptions) bridges to Corporate Event Coverage, reinforcing the cross-service connection.

---

## **SECTION 5: The Recurring Relationship**

This section is critical. It differentiates the service from a one-off booking and speaks directly to the recurring nature of these organizations' event calendars.

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** Built for the Long Run

**\[H2 Heading\]** Your Events Are Recurring. Your Media Partner Should Be Too.

**\[Body Paragraph 1\]** Most of the organizations we work with don't hold one event a year — they hold them monthly or quarterly. A Chamber luncheon every month. An association mixer every quarter. A young professionals event every six weeks. When we cover your events on a recurring basis, something valuable happens: we already know your people, your sponsors, your venue rhythm, and your brand. There's no ramp-up. Every event is smoother than the last.

**\[Body Paragraph 2\]** Over time, your organization builds a professional media library that tells a visual story of growth, engagement, and community. That library becomes one of the most powerful assets you have for sponsor proposals, membership campaigns, grant applications, and organizational credibility. Each event adds to it.

**\[Closing Line\]** This isn't a vendor relationship. It's a media partnership that compounds.

### **Implementation Notes**

* This section can be a full-width text block with generous padding — no image needed. The message carries the weight.  
* Alternatively, a subtle before/after visual: "Event 1 with JHR" vs. "Event 12 with JHR — a growing media library" could be compelling if a real example exists.  
* This is the section that turns a $850 booking into a $10K+ annual relationship. Give it room.

---

## **SECTION 6: What's Included — Package Clarity**

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** What's Included

**\[H2 Heading\]** Everything Your Event Needs. One Package. No Surprises.

**\[Lead Paragraph\]** The Social & Networking Media Package is designed to be simple: one operator, one evening, complete coverage, fast delivery. Here's what's included in every engagement.

**\[Included Items\]**

* **Up to 3 Hours of Professional Coverage** — Arrival through wrap. We capture the full arc of your event — arrivals, conversations, speakers, sponsors, candids, and group moments.

* **Same-Day Highlight Delivery** — 5–10 curated images delivered before the night is over. Ready for immediate social posting by your marketing team.

* **2 Instagram Reels** — Short-form video content produced on-site during your event. Designed for Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, and Stories. Delivered rapidly for same-day or next-day posting.

* **Full Curated Gallery — 24-Hour Delivery** — Your complete event gallery, professionally curated, delivered within 24 hours. Organized and ready for marketing, communications, and sponsor reporting.

* **Event & Host Branding Coverage** — Signage, sponsor logos, branded environments, and organizational presence documented for partner reporting and marketing collateral.

* **Designed for Social Amplification** — Every image is composed to be shareable. When attendees receive their photos, they post them — extending your event's reach to professional networks your organization couldn't access directly.

* **Final Frame Guarantee™** — Every delivered image meets JHR's professional quality standard.

### **Implementation Notes**

* Clean grid or list. Same format as other service pages for consistency.  
* No pricing on this page. Investment discussed in the strategy call.

## **SECTION 7: Upgrade Path — When You Need More**

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** Need More?

**\[H2 Heading\]** Scale Up When the Event Calls For It

**\[Body\]** The standard package covers most professional networking events perfectly. But if your event has a larger scope, a longer program, or a need for more produced video content, we can scale.

**\[Upgrade Option 1\]**

**Additional Reels** Need more than 2 reels? We can add additional short-form videos to cover different moments, sponsors, or speakers — produced on-site with the same rapid delivery.

**\[Upgrade Option 2\]**

**Extended Coverage** Event running longer than 3 hours? We extend coverage to match your program without disrupting the flow.

**\[Upgrade Option 3\]**

**Produced Event Highlight Video** Want a polished, edited highlight video (60–90 seconds) in addition to the reels? We can pair this package with our [Event Highlight System™](https://claude.ai/services/event-video-systems) for a more produced recap — ideal for events with larger sponsor commitments or annual showcase moments.

**\[Upgrade Option 4\]**

**Multi-Event Packages** Running monthly or quarterly events? Ask about recurring packages that keep your media consistent across your full event calendar — with a partnership structure that rewards the long-term relationship.

**\[CTA Line\]** Tell us about your event and we'll recommend the right scope.

### **Implementation Notes**

* This section is brief and scannable. It's not a pricing page — it's a "yes, we can do more" signal.  
* The multi-event package mention reinforces the recurring relationship angle from Section 5\.  
* Links to Event Video Systems for the produced highlight upgrade.

---

## **SECTION 8: Social Proof**

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** From the Organizations We Work With

**\[H2 Heading\]** Their Events. Their Feed. Their Growth.

**\[PLACEHOLDER — Testimonial 1: Chamber / Business Association\]** Quote should reference: how professional media elevated their events, increased social engagement, or supported sponsor and membership value. Bonus if it mentions recurring coverage.

Attribution:

* Name, Title  
* Organization Type: Chamber of Commerce / Business Association

**\[PLACEHOLDER — Testimonial 2: Entrepreneur Center / Community Org\]** Quote should reference: event energy captured professionally, social media impact, or how the content attracted new participants/sponsors.

Attribution:

* Name, Title  
* Organization Type: Entrepreneur Center / Community Organization

**\[PLACEHOLDER — Testimonial 3: Attendee / Member Perspective (Optional)\]** Quote from an attendee about seeing event photos on social media and being motivated to attend the next event — or about resharing the content. This proves the UGC amplification loop from the end user's perspective.

Attribution:

* Name, Title  
* "Member / Attendee at \[Organization Name\]"

### **Implementation Notes**

* 2–3 testimonials. If only 2 strong ones exist, use 2\.  
* The attendee/member testimonial is particularly valuable here because it proves the amplification thesis — the content drove engagement beyond the room.

## **SECTION 9: FAQ — Social & Networking Media**

### **Copy**

**\[Eyebrow Text\]** Common Questions

**\[H2 Heading\]** Social & Networking Media FAQs

---

**Q: What's the difference between this and Corporate Event Coverage?**

A: The Social & Networking Media Package is designed for shorter, single-evening events — networking mixers, cocktail hours, association meetups, and community gatherings, typically 2–4 hours. The focus is on fast-turn, social-first content: same-day highlights and Instagram Reels delivered while the event is still fresh. [Corporate Event Coverage™](https://claude.ai/services/corporate-event-coverage) is built for full-day and multi-day events like conferences, annual meetings, and training summits, with a more comprehensive documentation approach and a 72-hour gallery delivery window. If your event includes both — a daytime conference and an evening reception — we can bundle both services so the full program is covered by one team.

---

**Q: How fast do we get the photos?**

A: Fast. You'll receive 5–10 curated highlight images the same evening — typically before your team leaves the venue. These are ready to post immediately on social media. Your full curated gallery is delivered within 24 hours. The 2 Instagram Reels are delivered same-day or next-day, depending on when your event ends.

---

**Q: What are the Instagram Reels? Are those separate from photography?**

A: The 2 Instagram Reels are short-form video content — 15 to 60 seconds each — produced on-site during your event by your JHR operator. They're designed for Instagram Reels, LinkedIn, TikTok, and Stories. Think of them as the video version of your event's highlight photos: fast, dynamic, and built to perform on social feeds. They're included in every Social & Networking Media Package — not a separate add-on.

---

**Q: Can attendees use the photos on their own social media?**

A: Absolutely — and we encourage it. When attendees receive professional photos from your event and post them on their own LinkedIn, Instagram, or company pages, your organization's brand reaches professional networks you couldn't access through your own channels alone. This organic amplification is one of the most valuable outcomes of the package. We shoot with this in mind — every image is composed to be shareable, taggable, and worth posting.

---

**Q: We host events monthly (or quarterly). Can we set up a recurring arrangement?**

A: Yes, and this is one of the most common ways organizations use this service. Chambers, associations, entrepreneur centers, and professional groups that hold regular events benefit from a recurring media partnership. Over time, we already know your people, your venues, your sponsors, and your brand rhythm — so every event runs smoother and the content gets stronger. We also build a growing media library for your organization that becomes a powerful asset for membership, sponsorship proposals, and organizational credibility. Ask about our recurring event packages when we talk.

---

**Q: We have a limited event budget. Is this realistic for us?**

A: This package is specifically designed for organizations that need professional media on practical budgets. It's a single operator, a focused engagement window (up to 3 hours), and a streamlined delivery — same-day highlights, 2 reels, and a 24-hour gallery. You get professional coverage and social-ready content without the scope or investment of a full-day event coverage package. It's one of the highest-value services we offer relative to what it delivers.

---

**Q: Can you cover our event if it runs longer than 3 hours?**

A: Yes. The standard package covers up to 3 hours, which fits most networking events, mixers, and social gatherings. If your event runs longer — say a 4–5 hour program with a speaker component and a reception — we can extend coverage to match. We'll discuss your event's timeline and recommend the right scope.

---

**Q: What if we also want a produced highlight video — not just reels?**

A: The standard package includes 2 Instagram Reels, which are designed for social-first, fast-turn impact. If you're looking for a more polished, edited highlight video (60–90 seconds) for your website, sponsor presentations, or annual recap, we can pair this package with our [Event Highlight System™](https://claude.ai/services/event-video-systems). That gives you the fast social content from the reels AND a produced video deliverable with licensed music, color grading, and professional editing. It's a popular pairing for annual galas, milestone events, and high-visibility programs.

---

**Q: Do you cover events outside of Nashville?**

A: Our Social & Networking Media Package is designed around our Nashville-based operators and the venues we know well. If your organization hosts events in the Nashville metro area, we're set up to support you. For events outside Nashville, reach out and we'll discuss whether we can accommodate based on location and logistics.

---

**Q: What kind of events is this NOT right for?**

A: This package is built for short, single-evening events — not multi-day conferences, trade shows, or full-day corporate programs. If your event spans a full day or multiple days, [Corporate Event Coverage™](https://claude.ai/services/corporate-event-coverage) is the right fit. If you're exhibiting at a trade show and need a booth activation, that's our [Headshot Activation™](https://claude.ai/services/headshot-activation). And if you need dedicated executive headshots or leadership portraits, that's handled through our [Corporate Headshot Program](https://claude.ai/services/corporate-headshot-program). This page is specifically for the networking mixer, the cocktail meetup, the quarterly gathering, and the professional social event.

---

### **Implementation Notes**

* Accordion/collapsible format. Same pattern as other service page FAQs.  
* Internal links connect to Corporate Event Coverage, Event Video Systems, Headshot Activation, and Corporate Headshot Program — strengthening site-wide internal linking.  
* FAQ schema markup (JSON-LD) for SEO.  
* The budget question is answered honestly and confidently. No apology for the price point, no "discount" framing. It's positioned as high-value, right-sized — exactly what it is.
